# College-Placement-Prediction
1. About the Dataset
Description:
The dataset you have in mind consists of three features:

CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average): This represents the average of grades obtained in all subjects throughout the course.
IQ (Intelligence Quotient): This is a measure of cognitive ability.
Placement (Binary): This indicates whether a student got placed (1) or did not get placed (0) after completing their education.

Project Idea:
Given this dataset, here are a few project ideas you can consider:

1. Binary Classification Model: Placement Prediction
Problem Statement: Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a student will get placed based on their CGPA and IQ.

Steps:

Data Collection: Gather and clean the dataset, ensuring there are no missing values or outliers.
Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of CGPA and IQ scores and their relationship with placement outcomes.
Data Preprocessing: Normalize or scale the numerical features (CGPA, IQ) if necessary. Encode categorical variables (if any).
Model Selection: Choose a suitable classification algorithm such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the chosen model on the training set.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
